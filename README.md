### My Remarks (Silvio)

- I built a simple app `Reactive Beers` that lists some üçª-data fetched from a public API ([Punk API](https://punkapi.com/))
- Nothing exciting feature-wise, you can simply filter the list by using the input and clear the input with a button
- This is my first time building something with React & Redux, so be gentle ;)

#### Dev Environment

It's a straightforward environment build on yarn and webpack. Install all dependencies with `yarn install`, start the local server at port 3000 with `yarn start` and run the tests with `yarn test`.
